## React Hooks Practice

This project is one of the side projects that is included to [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

#### Note

In this project, thus far I've used

- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `useReducer`
- `useContext` Hooks in a way that make my knowledge stronger about them.
